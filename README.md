# Abstract:
This web application integrates powerful bioinformatics tools to facilitate sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing BLAST searches, GenBank data retrieval, MegaBLAST for high-speed sequence alignment, and phylogenetic tree generation.
## Type of Analysis from Genbank search
1. Sequence Alignment and Conservation
    
- Purpose: Compare variations and identify conserved and variable regions.

    - Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):
Use tools like Clustal Omega, MUSCLE, or MAFFT to align sequences.
    - Identify conserved regions, which may indicate functionally important or evolutionary conserved areas.
- Visualization:
    - Sequence Logo
        - Highlights conserved regions vs. mutations in a heatmap.

2. Mutation Analysis
- Purpose: Identify and analyze variations (SNPs, insertions, deletions) between sequences.

- Graphical Representations:
    - Variant Map: Plot positions of SNPs or mutations along the gene.
    - Pie Chart/Bar Chart: Show the frequency of different mutation types (e.g., transitions, transversions).

    - Synonymous vs. Non-Synonymous Mutations:
Analyze whether mutations affect the amino acid sequence.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# NCBI E-utility API
The Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) are a set of nine server-side programs that provide a stable interface into the Entrez query and database system at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The E-utilities use a fixed URL syntax that translates a standard set of input parameters into the values necessary for various NCBI software components to search for and retrieve the requested data.

Use the E-utility URL

All E-utility requests should be made to URLs beginning with the following string:

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/
